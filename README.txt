HOW TO PLAY:

-You are a ship in dangerous enemy space. The asteroid field gives good cover, but also has some dangers of their own!
-In order to survive, you have a High Impact Plasma Cannon. Fire this cannon with the SPACEBAR to asteroids (and other enemies)
-The ship always points to where the mouse is.
-You may move your ship with the WASD keys. Though be warned! A and D only rotate the ship slightly.
-Avoid asteroids (and other threats). Your hull can only take 3 hits before collapsing.
-When you die, record your score and perhaps retry the game.
-Press ESC to pause the game. Here there are multiple options available to you: saving, loading, looking at the leaderboard 
 and continuing or quitting the game. You may also press ESC on any menu to go back.
-the top 15 scores are displayed. Can you make it onto the list?
